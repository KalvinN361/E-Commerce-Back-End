  ## Description
A database is essential to any application that collects data. Larger applications typically collect more dataâ€”making data management more complex. For example, we might have to compare data across databases, migrate an app's existing database, or even use various types of databases. Object-relational mapping (ORM) makes these tasks more manageable by helping us to interact with databases using JavaScript.

We can choose from many ORM tools, but for this unit we will use Sequelize. A popular JavaScript ORM that uses object-oriented programming, Sequelize enables us to communicate with Postgres, MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite, and Microsoft SQL Server using Node.js. It also helps make relationships between the data easier to recognize and leverage. Thus, we can see how the data interacts much better than we could with plain SQL.
